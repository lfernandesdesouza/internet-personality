		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<p>Mario was first created y a japonese video game designer called Shigeru Miyamoto, and was presented to the world along side the first game of the Mario Bros franchise in 1985. After that date, many other Mario games would be published and he would become a simbol of video games in the early 2000's. With games like Super Mario Bros, Mario Galaxy, Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine, the red hatted character would gain an imense amount of success. But how came the idea of creating this franchise?</p>

		<h2>The Super Mario Bros Franchise</h2>
		<p>Published originally in 1985, as previously mentioned, the franchise would come to publish more then 20 games, all featuring Mario and his friends living insane adventures. Miyamoto wasn't the one who thought of the game, he was just the designer. The game developper said that he thought of it to be a simple game to cure boredom, as he thought of it whilst himself was bored. That's why the first game is so "simple", just a character killing enemys and chasing his princess that was stolen by a evil turtle. It's safe to say that neither of them had any idea of what the franchise would end up becoming, known wolrdwide for creating one of the first 3d games and innovating in many other areas.</p>
